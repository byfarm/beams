R;1;10
P;5,5
D;1:3,5 
M;4,5;5,4

key: 
    R = reaction
    P = point force
    D = destributed load
    M = moment
Notation:
    ; = new force
    a,b = force at a with magnitude b
    a:b,c = force destributed from a to b with magnitude c

    summary:
        1st number is location
        :# is a destributed load
        last number is magnitude
