need to fix the solve reaction function for when either support is not at the end of the beam

for slanted destributed loads, pass in as 
    D;start:stop,pressurexfactor
    on pasrse, split the pressure and factor via x
    assign dload struct a factor attribute
    use factor attribute when solveing for reactions and shear/moments
        ex moment = pressure * exp(x, factor)
